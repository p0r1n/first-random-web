A beginner's adventure to her first webpage

Just attempting to play around with the codes I learned to make a fun and interact-able website using my favorite character :) 

I'm still a beginner at HTML, CSS and JS so this is in early development! 

There are still errors and lots of stuff I haven't added into it 

Feel free to test it out and give me feedbacks and tips!
